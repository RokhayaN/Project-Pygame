# Project-Pygame
 

Terminal-based Python game

 I m using Python to create a simple yet interactive battle game between Heroes and Vilains

 In this project i m using my knowelge about Objects, data structures and control flow in python .

 To play the game make sure you have python installed in your laptop. You can then run <Pygame.py> file in your terminal by clicking the run code button 
 
 Right-click anywhere in the editor window and select Run Python File in Terminal (which saves the file automatically):
Select one or more lines, then press Shift+Enter or right-click and select Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal.
